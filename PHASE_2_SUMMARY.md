  - Automatic total time calculation
  - Servings count and notes
  - Grid layout

##### `RecipeTagsSection.tsx`

  - Dietary restriction toggles
  - Common tags selection
  - Selected tags display with badges
  - Toggle functionality for all selections

##### `RecipeSharingSection.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Sharing and privacy settings
- **Extracted from**: `src/components/recipes/RecipeForm.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Public/private recipe toggle
  - Comments and ratings permissions
  - Helpful explanatory text
  - Checkbox-based interface

### 3. Index File Updates

#### `src/components/meal-planning/index.ts`
- Added exports for all new meal planning components
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing components

#### `src/components/recipes/index.ts`
- Added exports for all new recipe form components
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing components

#### `src/hooks/index.ts`
- Added exports for all new custom hooks
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing hooks

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. **Improved Maintainability**
- Large components broken down into focused, single-responsibility components
- Business logic extracted into reusable custom hooks
- Clear separation of concerns

### 2. **Enhanced Reusability**
- Form sections can be reused across different forms
- Custom hooks can be shared between components
- Consistent patterns established

### 3. **Better Testing**
- Smaller components are easier to test in isolation
- Custom hooks can be tested independently
- Clear interfaces make mocking easier

### 4. **Improved Developer Experience**
- Easier to locate specific functionality
- Reduced cognitive load when working on individual features
- Better code organization and structure

### 5. **Performance Benefits**
- Smaller components can be optimized individually
- Custom hooks can implement memoization strategies
- Reduced re-renders through better state management

## Files Reduced in Size

### Before Refactoring:
- `src/app/meal-planning/page.tsx`: 852 lines
- `src/components/recipes/RecipeForm.tsx`: 729 lines

### After Refactoring:
- `src/app/meal-planning/page.tsx`: ~400 lines (estimated)
- `src/components/recipes/RecipeForm.tsx`: ~300 lines (estimated)

## Next Steps for Phase 2

### Remaining Tasks:
1. **Refactor the main meal planning page** to use the new hooks and components
2. **Refactor the RecipeForm component** to use the new form sections
3. **Create additional utility hooks** for common patterns
4. **Add comprehensive tests** for new components and hooks
5. **Document component APIs** and usage patterns

### Phase 2 Completion Criteria:
- [ ] Main meal planning page refactored to use new hooks
- [ ] RecipeForm component refactored to use new sections
- [ ] All new components tested
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] No regression in functionality

## Impact on Codebase

### Lines of Code Reduction:
- **Estimated reduction**: ~600 lines from main components
- **New files created**: 12 new components and hooks
- **Net effect**: Better organized, more maintainable codebase

### Architecture Improvements:
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each component has one clear purpose
- **Dependency Inversion**: Components depend on abstractions (hooks) not concrete implementations
- **Open/Closed Principle**: New form sections can be added without modifying existing ones
- **Interface Segregation**: Components only depend on the interfaces they need

This refactoring sets the foundation for Phase 3 (Performance Optimizations) and Phase 4 (TODO Implementation) by creating a more modular and maintainable codebase.
